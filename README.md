## Reproducibility
The algorithms and methods used in this research were implemented using pre-trained BERT and ELECTRA models from Hugging Face. These models were fine-tuned on a tweet sentiment dataset from https://huggingface.co/datasets/cardiffnlp/tweet_eval. The notebooks provided contain all the necessary code to replicate the results.
